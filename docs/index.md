#### Intellectual 


##### Classical Education 

- **Philosophy** 
    
       Political philosophy studies how political authority is justified and limited, how law and power relate to justice, and how societies should balance order, liberty, equality, and property, moving from foundational questions about the state and human nature to debates over rights, sovereignty, democracy, and obligation.

      
     A structured approach typically begins with classical foundations in **Plato** and **Aristotle**, develops through early-modern theories of sovereignty and the social contract in **Thomas Hobbes**, **John Locke**, and **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**, and then branches into modern tradition: republicanism (**Niccolò Machiavelli**, **Philip Pettit**), liberalism (**John Stuart Mill**, **John Rawls**), conservatism (**Edmund Burke**, **Michael Oakeshott**), socialism and communism (**Karl Marx**, **Friedrich Engels**), and libertarianism (<a href="./Intellectual/">**Hayek**</a>, **Robert Nozick**), alongside rigorous analyses of authority, legitimacy, and the state by thinkers such as **Max Weber**, **Hannah Arendt**, and **Carl Schmitt**.
