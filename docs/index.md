**God willing and I live** these are some of the ideas for personal development that I have. I want to track these and hopefully progress in these areas.

### Areas for Development 

#### Spiritual 

*Prayer*

Prayer is communion with God Almighty. This is a privilege that we as Christians have, to speak with the creator of the Universe. 

*Bible Study*

God, speaks to us through his Holy Word. In English, this is the King James Version 1611. I would want to have multiple translations in other languages, in particular in *French*, *German*, *Spanish*, *Greek* for the New Testament and *Hebrew* for the Old Testament. Additionally I'd like Motu, Sinaugoro and Tuaripi versions as well. 

- Fellowship 
- Tithing
